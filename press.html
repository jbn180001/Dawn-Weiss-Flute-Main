  <p><b>Nielsen &quot;Concerto for Flute and Orchestra&quot; with the Vancouver Symphony, Salvador Brotons, Conductor </b><br  />Her years of skill were immediately obvious in the delicate, nuanced fluidity of her playing. She made the extremely difficult flute solo, marked by numerous dizzying cadenzas, come off sounding effortless and smooth, the mark of a great soloist. She used the flute's lower registers brilliantly, delivering a deliciously husky timbre when playing down low.<br />

     <p><b>Nielsen &quot;Concerto for Flute and Orchestra&quot; with the Vancouver Symphony, Salvador Brotons, Conductor </b><br  />Weiss used a nice palate of colors to make her passages inviting and engaging. The conversation was often congenial yet darting as Weiss deftly handled passages that scampered about. She also phrased the brief lyrical themes with grace and kept the mood playful and vivid.<br />
      <cite>James Bash, The Columbian. January 17, 2009</cite></p>
    <p><b>Mozart &quot;Concerto for Flute and Harp&quot; with the Oregon Mozart Players, Ching-Hsin Hsu, Conductor </b><br  />Guest artists Dawn Weiss and Jennifer Craig are principal flute and harp for the Oregon Symphony and they grabbed the Concerto for Flute, Harp and Orchestra by the ears and ran with it.  ...Weiss is an assured and tasteful flutist, playing the solo lines with immense art and craft - she seemed to enjoy every minute...both played with confidence and some wonderful nuances, in good balance with the orchestra.  Overall, a charming performance of a familiar beloved work.<br />

      Flutist's solo caps concerts...Oregon Symphony Principal Flutist Dawn Weiss stepped out of the ranks Sunday to perform as soloist in Mozart's flute concerto (in G Major), a work she has been playing with the orchestra during a state tour this month.  Miss Weiss...settled into the kind of responsible phrasing and musicianship that she has exhibited all season from her regular seat in the orchestra.<br />

    <p><b>Mozart &quot;Flute Concerto in G Major&quot;, with the Oregon Symphony on tour, James DePreist, Conductor</b><br  />
      The concerto was notable for the delicate shadings in the flute solo passages that were echoed in the orchestra and the clear yet gentle modulations by Ms. Weiss. Her solo passage at the end of the allegro and the melodious solo in the adagio non troppo displayed her understanding of Mozart and the perfection of the composer's form<br /><cite>Mary Ann Campbell, Mail Tribune, Medford, OR, May 18, 1981</cite></p>
    <p><b>Telemann &quot;Suite in A Minor&quot; with the Debut Orchestra of the Young Musician's Foundation, Michael Nowak, Conductor</b><br  /> 
      Dawn Weiss...showed excellent musicianship and real stylistic flair...in Telemann's Suite in A Minor, her skillful phrasing brought out all of the piece's sensuality without any romantic excesses.<br />

    <p>
      <b>Mozart &quot;Flute Concerto in D Major&quot; Pasadena Symphony, Daniel Lewis, Conductor</b><br  /> 
      Flutist Dawn Weiss, winner of the [Pasadena Symphony] Orchestra's competition last spring was the soloist of the occasion, playing Mozart's Second Flute Concerto with expected fluency plus unexpected aplomb and musicality.  In fact this performance, accompanied adroitly and lovingly by [Daniel] Lewis and a reduced orchestra, had to be one of the Mozartean peaks of this calendar year, locally. Miss Weiss' playing of the cadenzas, for example, was accomplished without any sense of duty or self-display.  Each solo seemed to come out of the moment, spontaneously, and in mesh with its surroundings.<br />
      <cite>Daniel Cariaga, Los Angeles Times, December 24, 1973</cite></p>
    <p><b>Nielsen &quot;Flute Concerto&quot; with the Santa Barbara Music Academy of the West, Maurice Abravanel, Conductor</b><br  />
      Dawn [Weiss] is a flutist of the first rank, and I'm certain she will be taking her place in some outstanding organization after leaving the Academy.<br />

    <p><b>Weiss Family Woodwinds Album</b><br />
      &quot;...even the great Gomberg brothers and other familial musical pairs must defer to the Weiss siblings:  David, currently co-principal oboist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Abe, principal bassoonist of the Rochester Philharmonic; and Dawn, a flutist with the Oregon Symphony.  It isn't merely their family relationship that makes this program one of the best of those I've heard lately in Crystal's recital series, although the kinship may well account for the combined precision and freedom of the ensemble playing in the delectably cheerful yet songful Vivaldi Sonata, which is new to me. The individual Weiss's performances, each with Zita Carno, ...are all first-rate... The selections vary widely...with Messiaen's rhapsodically improvisatory Blackbird.<br />
    <cite>R. D. Darrell...High Fidelity, June, 1979</cite></p>
    <p><b>Weiss Family Woodwinds Album</b><br />Three talented siblings demonstrate the fine solo musicianship which has resulted in individual success. Their performance of the Sonata in G Minor, which captures Vivaldi's wind writing, serves as an excellent example of their combined effort. Le Merle Noir (The Blackbird) demonstrates Messiaen's fine birdsong writing. The piece demands virtuosity in the performance of the runs and flutter tonguing it contains. Dawn Weiss's response is a pleasing combination of technique and musicianship.<br /><cite>The Instrumentalist, July 1979</cite></p>
    <p><b>Weiss Family Woodwinds Album</b><br />The performance (Vivaldi's Sonata in G Minor) is full of life. Messiaen's Le Merle Noir for flute and piano...expertly played...Good Sound, enjoyable listening<br /><cite>H. Royer Smith Company, &quot;The New Records&quot;, April 1979</cite></p>

    <p><b>Smetena &quot;The Moldau&quot;</b> is a symphonic favorite because of its vivid musical images of a river that rushes past a village wedding, reflecting moonlight off its surface and tumbling over rapids.

    <p><b>Beethoven &quot;Symphony #7&quot;</b><br /> Principal flutist Dawn Weiss delivered the theme with spotless tone and rhythm. Every grace note could be heard. Beethoven's rhythms in this symphony are unusually persistent, challenging the stamina of all the players, but particularly the woodwinds.

    <p><b>Benjamin Lees &quot;Portrait of Rodin&quot;</b><br /> On first hearing, the work seemed effective, highly evocative, even mysterious.

    <p><b>Beethoven &quot;Symphony #7&quot;</b><br /> The woodwinds were never tentative and never ragged in a score notable for its rhythms and its offbeat accents.

    <p><b>Music by Debussy</b><br />... expressive live playing from Dawn Weiss (flute) and John Mery (guitar).   <br /><cite>Willamette Week, March 14, 2007</cite></p>
    <p>The work is set to <b>Claude Debussy</b>, and some of the score is played live, with exquisite work by Dawn Weiss and John Mery on flute and guitar, respectively.  <br /><cite>Oregonian, March 12, 2007</cite></p>
    <p><b>Mozart &quot;Quartet in D Major, K. 285&quot;  with Ensemble Capriccio for the  8th International Music Festival in San Jose, Costa Rica, performed in El Teatro Nacional.</b> <br />Del Cuarteto con Flauta en Re Mayor K. 285 la flautista Dawn Weiss produjo una versión con una técnica instrumental sumamente depurada, un sonido sobrio, íntimo y dulce, dando la sensación de la utilización de un instrumento de la época. Escuchamos un empleo del vibrato puesto en su lugar: a veces hay flautistas que vibran cada nota que tocan, no importando el estilo de la obra. El control de la respiración dictó la ortografía musical de Mozart. El uso del vibrato en un instrumento de viento a la hora de tocar Mozart es un elemento muy específico; por lo tanto, hay que saber aplicarlo como lo hizo la flautista. Hubo mucho énfasis en la articulación por parte de todo el grupo. <br /><cite>José Manuel Rojas, La Nación, August 9, 1998</cite></p>
    <p><b>American Music Recital in Salt Lake City, Utah </b> <br />More recently I delighted in UFA's (Utah Flute Association's) Dawn Weiss recital, which was feast for both ears and eyes! Dawn's playing was not only clean and imaginative, but she used the props available on the Jewett stage, and also performed in four different outfits! I was really moved by her playing of James DeMars' “The Seventh Healing Song of John Joseph” for flute and tape. Suddenly her silver flute was a Native American ceremonial flute, and her every movement was choreographed to lend the performance that kind of enchantment. <br /><cite>Karen Perkins, President's Message in UFA's Newsletter “Flute Facts”, November 20, 1992</cite></p>
    <p><b>"Music in Revue – Flute Recital or Performance Art?" in Salt Lake City, Utah</b> 
      <br />Dawn Weiss gave an extraordinary concert of all American music for the UFA on November 20. Her musical interpretations were enhanced with costume changes, props and special lighting for each different piece, and interesting comments about each work. She opened with the “Renaissance Concerto” by Lukas Foss. The stage was adorned with period costumes and hats. Candlelight set the mood for Bernard Rogers Soliloquy and a bowl of peaches added a nice touch to Andre Previn's “Peaches.: Dawn donned a native American costume and entered the stage beating a drum for the Seventh Healing Song of John Joseph. She also added choreography, flowing around the stage with the music. Her presentation of the Griffes “Poem” was breath-takingly beautiful and technically superb. Deep purple and red lighting lent a jazz club feeling for the Muczinsky Sonata. Dawn also performed William Billingsley's Flute Sonata. Ms. Weiss described this piece as being a very organic twelve-tone piece with musical lines that resembled such natural phenomena as waterfalls and reflections, for which she displayed a mirror on the concert shell to represent reflections. It was beautifully performed and very enjoyable to listen to. The composer, Mr. Billingsley, drove down from Idaho to attend the performance. Dawn's musicality and skill were truly inspiring. She developed a wonderful musical rapport with pianist Jed Moss. This was the most original recital the UFA has ever hosted. <br /><cite>November 20, 1992</cite></p>
    <p><b>Bryan Johanson  “Nero's Flute”</b> performed with two electric guitars and two marimbas “jumped off the stage with excitement. “Nero's Flute” is a free fantasy based on the personality of the crazed Roman emperor…. Dawn Weiss, better known as the Oregon Symphony's principal flutist, played the demanding solo part…Precipitous scales, florid solo cadenzas and contrasting (schizoid?) tones of brilliance and softness created a vivid impression. The writing didn't begin to exploit the accompanying instruments. Johanson's intent was to keep the flute squarely in the foreground. Weiss gave an assured performance.<br /><cite>David Stabler, The Oregonian, November 6, 1991</cite></p>
    <p><b>American Music Recital for the Third Festival of International Flutists in Miraflores, Lima, Peru.</b><br />
      available in Spanish. <!--Dawn Weiss, flautista norteamericana, puso de manifiesto condiciones sobresalientes....En la segunda parte, la flautista norteamericana Dawn Weiss, cuyo programa reun�a obras de singular relieve art�stico, ostent� a trav�s de su repertorio una versatilidad a toda prueba. Por versatilidad se entiende: no hacer de todo; sino hacer de todo y hacerlo con autoridad y jerarqu�a, que es uno de los potulados irrenunciables del arte. El detalle de la propuesta fue el siguiente: Sonate in E-dur: J.S. Bach, Duo para flauta y piano: Aaron Copeland; Soliloquy para flauta y piano: Bernard Rogers:The Seventh Healing Song of John Joseph James De Mars (Blue) para flauta y grabaci�n; Sonate (1936): Paul Hindemith. 
      La mencionada solista acus� un grado de madurez interpretativo que se dej� traslucir desde la primera obra inscrita. Puso de manifiesto condiciones sobresalientes, denotando en su labor una sonoridad expresiva y una t�cnica segura, toc� con nervio y temperamento, demonstrando que sus recursos son de una amplitud y variedad impresionante. La versi�n de Copeland fue una de las mejores escuchadas en estos �ltimos a�os. 
      Fue c�lidamente ovacionada por el p�blico asistente. La pianista Carla Ducatto tuvo lucida actuaci�n como acompa�ante.<br /> -->
