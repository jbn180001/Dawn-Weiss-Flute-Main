			<h1><a href="#elizabeth-rowe-2">Elizabeth Rowe is redefining what it means to be a woman in the classical music industry</h1>
			
				<time datetime="05-01-2020">MAY 1, 2020</time>
			<p>
				<em>Elizabeth Rowe</em> stands pensively at a crosswalk that will lead her to the 
				New England Conservatory. Her shivering hands are protected deep within 
				the pockets of her parka. The temperature outside is below freezing, and 
				the black roads are caked in a doughy layer of snow. Across from her, an 
				angry orange stoplight does little to deter the pedestrians around her; 
				this is Boston, after all. Pedestrians jaywalk off the curb, unrepentant 
				towards the cars blaring their horns, their shoulders hunched as they walk 
				with an agitated gait to their next destination.

			</p>

			<p>
				Elizabeth Rowe, however, is the last one standing on the sidewalk, 
				completely unbothered by the normalcy of the situation. The walk light 
				turns white, and she steps off the curb. When an unknowing car juts out 
				in front of her, she stops, graciously motioning for the car to proceed 
				before she does.
			</p>

			<p>
				Her gestures are subtle and seemingly inconsequential, but they stick out 
				juxtaposed with the rest of the Bostonians. It's essentially a small window 
				into Roweâ€™s personality: Conscientious, diplomatic, the modern-day Ruth Bader 
				Ginsburg of the classical music industry.
			</p>

			<p>
				"I've always had a strong standpoint to treat people as people first before 
				anything else," Rowe admits later in an interview, her light green eyes in a 
				gaze that reveals her prudent nature. Elizabeth Rowe is the kind of person 
				who understands the influence of her words and she selects them judiciously. 
				"I have always tried to relate to the people in my environment with as much 
				empathy, respect, and humanity as I can."

			</p>

			<p>
				As simple as this truth is, she lives by this mantra from day to day. In 2018, 
				Elizabeth Rowe garnered international attention when she filed a lawsuit against 
				the Boston Symphony Orchestra seeking over $200,000 in unpaid wages. The lawsuit 
				was the first of its kind under the Massachusetts Equal Pay Law, filed on the 
				basis of gender discrimination in comparison to Rowe's male coworker and fellow 
				principal oboist John Ferrillo.
